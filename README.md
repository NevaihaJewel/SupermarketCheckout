<h1>Supermarket Checkout System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a Supermarket Checkout System that simulates the process of manually entering item prices at a point-of-sale terminal due to a malfunctioning scanner. This program emphasizes error handling, calculation accuracy, and a smooth user experience.<br></br>
This demonstrates my proficiency in C programming, problem-solving, and attention to detail. By leveraging functions for tax and total calculation, I show my understanding of modular programming. The error-handling functionality highlights my ability to anticipate user mistakes and design systems that guide users toward correct behavior.<br></br>
<b>Key Features:</b>

- <b>Tax Calculation Functionality:</b> Implemented a function that computes a 6% sales tax based on the subtotal, providing a clear example of reusable code for financial calculations.
- <b>Total Calculation:</b> Another function was designed to compute the grand total by adding the tax to the subtotal, ensuring clarity and separation of logic.
- <b>Input Validation:</b> The program includes robust input validation, ensuring that all item prices remain under $10.00, reflecting my attention to data integrity and user constraints.
- <b>Interactive User Experience:</b> The program begins with a custom welcome message, walks the user through entering multiple item prices, and provides clear feedback for invalid entries. Upon completion, it outputs the subtotal, tax, and grand total with formatted precision.
